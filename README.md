- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my indie game project made with Godot that i'll probably never finish. ;)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to write better quality code.

- âš¡ Fun facts: 
    - I really love making video games, i played a lot with Unreal Engine, Godot, and coding a game myself in C++ with SDL,
      but i never finished fully a game because i'm not really an artist, and i can't create a stylish ui, characters, or world/scene (2d or 3d).
      I had an idea to create a game called MEME invaders (speaks for itself, a space invaders, but full of memes) but most of the fun/popular memes 
      are copyrighted sadly enough :/
