- âš¡ Fun facts: 
    - I really love making video games, i played a lot with Unreal Engine, Godot, and coding a game myself in c++ with SDL,
      but i never finished fully a game because i'm not really an artist, and i can't create a stylish ui, characters, or world/scene (2d or 3d).
      I had an idea to create a game called MEME invaders (speaks for itself, a space invaders, but full of memes) but most of the fun/popular memes 
      are copyrighted sadly enough :/
    - I had a Minecraft server, with only plugins made by myself, a really great fps games with a unique twist, battles with kits and superpowers,
      eggwars, and i was working on re-creating Dead By Daylight in Minecraft.But it never got a lot of player so i decided to stop it.
